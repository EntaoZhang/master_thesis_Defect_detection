# Part I: Defect detection 









# Part II: NLP application 

For NLP part, create a interactive troubleshooting interface for 3D pringting error which can 

- Generate diagnostic reports that combine image data (defect classification) with metadata (e.g., ex_mul, layer, printbed_color) and domain knowledge (e.g., extrusion physics).
- Create a visual question-answering (VQA) system where users ask troubleshooting questions about the print (e.g., "Why are there gaps in layer 20?").
- Build a text-image cross-modal search system that allows users to query specific fault cases (such as "wire drawing defects on the silver print bed") in natural language.
